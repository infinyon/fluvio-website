## Chaining

Using multiple SmartModules is possible with SmartModule chaining. The output of the previous SmartModule is used as the input of the next SmartModule. Therefore the ordering of the SmartModules in the chain is important

#### Chaining with SMDK



#### Cloud Pipelines with SmartModule Chaining

Examples on how to use SmartModules in a pipeline:
* [Build HTTP to SQL Pipeline]
* [Build MQTT to SQL Pipeline]
