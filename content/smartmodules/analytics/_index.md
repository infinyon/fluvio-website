## Data Transformations

The HTTP connector supports the following [SmartModules]({{<ref "/docs/smartmodules/overview/" >}}) for data transforamtions:

- `filter`: to eliminate invalid records
- `map`: to correct or transform data formats
- `filtermap`: to apply both, filter and map.
- `arraymap`: to divide a composite object into individual records.

Once a SmartModule is uploaded on the cluster, it can be referenced in the `parameters` section. In this example the http connector applies `catfact-map`.
