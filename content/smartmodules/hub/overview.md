SmartModule Hub, powered by [`InfinyOn Cloud`], is a real-time apps store, where developers publish SmartModules, and users download and integrate them into their data pipelines. 

Thie sections outlines core concepts of the SmartModule Hub.

* [Personas](#personas)
* [Certified SmartModules](#certified-smartmodules)
* [Private/Public SmartModules](#privatepublic-smartmodules)

If you want to skip ahead, checkout [SmartModule Operations](#smartmodule-operations). 

### Unique Identifier

Each SmartModule in the Hub is uniquely identified by a `group`, `name`, `version` aggregate. For example, the following SmartModules is published by `InfinyOn`:

```bash
infinyon/sql-json@0.1.0
```

SmartMoudle developers must choose a group `name` before they are allowed to publish to the Hub. Checkout [`SMDK section`] for more information. 

### Personas

The Hub use cases are centered around two distinct personas: `developers` and `users`. Developers create, test, and upload SmartModules, whereas users search and download SmartModules for their data pipelines. This separation, enabables non-developer pipeline operators to use the SmartModule Hub.

* **Developers** use [`SMDK cli`]: 

    ```bash
    $ smdk ...
    ```

* **Users** use [`Hub cli`]:

    ```bash
    $ fluvio hub ...
    ```

### Certified SmartModules

We built SmartModule Hub to democratize real-time application development. This mission mandates that anyone in the Fluvio community can upload SmartModules to the Hub. While, we use advanced security techniques to guarantee ownership, and walled gardens to sandbox runtinme functions, we cannot cannot guarantee the quality and intent of the community developed SmartModules.

**Certified SmartModules** alleviate this concern. A certified SmartModule ensures the SmartModule has been vetted by the InfinyOn team and deamed safe to use. 

Currently only InfinyOn SmartModule are certified, though we intend to roll-out a cerfitication process that enables the community to certify their own SmartModules. Please reach out on [`Discord`] if you are interested in the **SmartModule Certification** program.


### Private/Public SmartModules

SmartModules published to the Hub can `public` or `private`. Public SmartModules are visibile and downloadable by anyone, which private SmartModules are only visible to the owner. 

-> This feature is under development; please reach out on [`Discord`] to request early access.
