SmartModules are powerful components that enhance the functionality and flexibility of the Fluvio platform. They are programmable data streaming functions that serve as intelligent building blocks which enable users to create complex workflows and automate tasks with ease.

Think of SmartModules as specialized tools that can be combined and configured to perform specific actions or processes. They are designed to simplify and streamline various tasks, allowing users to achieve their objectives efficiently and reliably.
