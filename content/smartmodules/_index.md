SmartModules are programmable data streaming functions exposed to WebAssembly, allowing developers to manipulate data in real-time inside the Fluvio cluster without needing external services such as Lambda or Functions.

See the `Transform` and `Analytics` section for more info about the available SmartModule functions. 

If you are interested in building your own SmartModules, `smdk` will support your development

With an InfinyOn Cloud account, you can access pre-built SmartModules via Hub. These are maintained by InfinyOn for general use. Check out the list of `Certified` SmartModules for details
