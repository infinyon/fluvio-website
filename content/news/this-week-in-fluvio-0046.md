## Progress report:

### `fluvio connector` CLI deprecation
This is an update from the previous issue, which we announced the deprecation of the `fluvio connector` subcommand.

We are in process of creating an external CLI tool and documenting a migration strategy for our Open Source users to continue managing their connectors locally.

Rust devs can get a sneak peak of this tool in [our Connectors GitHub repo](https://github.com/infinyon/fluvio-connectors/tree/main/rust-connectors/utils/connector-run), which will continue to support your connector config files.

Please connect with us in [our Discord channel] or you can email us at [team@infinyon.com](mailto:team@infinyon.com) if there are any questions, concerns, comments, etc.

We'll continue to make updates about this matter until resolved.
