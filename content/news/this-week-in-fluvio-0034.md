## New video
Here's the recording from our CTO, Sehyo Chang's recent talk [Building a WASM Powered Distributed Streaming Platform](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVW9hPdfRdY) at [Cloud Native Wasm Day EU 2022](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/cloud-native-wasm-day-europe/).

It is about the design challenges experienced by today's stream processing architectures, and how [Fluvio SmartModules]({{<ref "/smartmodules">}}) leverage WebAssembly with Rust to solve these problems.
