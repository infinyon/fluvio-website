Alright, alright, alright! we are back on time for this week in Fluvio - 54.

This week hase been great with our efforts aligning towards our next release.

## Upcoming features
We have updates coming in the interface of the [SQL sink connector]('https://github.com/infinyon/sql-connector') that will provide the option to configure insert and upsert operations that we are about to release.

We spent some time working on a graphite connector which we will make available through [InfinyOn Labs]('https://github.com/infinyon/labs-projects')

## Developer experience improvements
We are also looking at the Fluvio [Python]('https://github.com/infinyon/fluvio-client-python') and [Go]('https://github.com/avinassh/fluvio-go') clients to get a baseline of functionality.

We are experimenting with how far we can push our core stream processor in terms of efficiency under significant storage and memory constraints.

## Open positions
We are hiring!
* [Sr. Rust Cloud Software Engineer](https://infinyon.com/careers/cloud-engineer-senior-level/)

## New blog post
[Upsert on SQL Sink Connector]('https://infinyon.com/blog/2023/07/sql-upsert/')

## New video

That's all folks. until next week.
