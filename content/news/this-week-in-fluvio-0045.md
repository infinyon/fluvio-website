## Upcoming deprecation

### `fluvio connector` CLI deprecation
We intend to remove the `fluvio connector` subcommand, and related API from the Fluvio open source project, and migrate the support of managed connectors to [InfinyOn Cloud](https://infinyon.cloud).

We will announce the release to expect this change ahead of time. Currently, we are updating our documentation with equivilent workflows in preparation to support OSS Fluvio users though this migration.

Please connect with us in [our Discord channel] or you can email us at [team@infinyon.com](mailto:team@infinyon.com) if there are any questions, concerns, comments, etc.

We'll continue to make updates about this matter until resolved.

## Upcoming InfinyOn Cloud update
We intend to continue support for managed connectors in the CLI in this environment.

Accompanying the removal of the `fluvio connector` CLI will be an update to the `fluvio cloud` CLI.
