  items:
    - title: "Unified Cluster"
      description: "A unified cluster for streaming and stateful computation minimizes delay, reduces operational complexity, and boosts security. When streaming and stateful computation are combined, it sets the foundation for a new class of real-time streaming use cases unique to Fluvio. For example:"
      examples:
        - "**Normalize**: remove null values, map invalid fields, filter out records, and more." 
        - "**Protect**: strip out personally identifiable information (PII), and encrypt fields." 
        - "**Refine**: compute aggregates, derive substreams, and more."
      icon: "/images/icons/unified-connected.svg"
    - title: "Extensible"
      description: "Fluvio uses WebAssembly(WASM) to extend real-time stateful computation to a countless number of use cases. Custom modules are loaded dynamically and applied to any number of data streams. For example:"
      examples:
        - "**Filter** patients with high blood sugar in real-time."
        - "**Count** all users that have a declined credit card transactions."
        - "**Transcode** video file when played to a mobile device with insufficient network bandwidth."
      icon: "/images/icons/extensible.svg"
    - title: "Efficient"
      description: "Fluvio is highly optimized for machine code, and it does not require a virtual machine or garbage collection. It can scale from IOT devices such as Raspberry Pi to multi-core servers."
      examples:
        - "**Low latency:** single-digit milliseconds response at high throughput and consistent variance."
        - "**Low footprint:** small executable and low memory."
        - "**Asynchronous architecture:** non-blocking calls to reduce latency and scale to a large number of concurrent streams."
      icon: "/images/icons/efficient.svg"    
    - title: "Self Healing"
      description: "Fluvio operates the cluster automatically with minimum human intervention. The platform implements self-healing by combining a variety of technologies:"
      examples:
        - "**Declarative Management**: a technology pattern where users declare intent and the system provisions resources as they become available."
        - "**Reconciliation:** the cluster continuously checks system components and brings them to a stable state."
        - "**Replication:** all data streams can have multiple copies to reduce the possibility of data loss during outages." 
      icon: "/images/icons/self-healing.svg"   
    - title: "Developer Friendly"
      description: "Fluvio was built with the development community in mind. It offers a powerful CLI for operational efficiency and native language bindings for most common programming languages. For example:"
      examples:
        - "**One-Click Deploy:** create a cluster locally `fluvio cluster start` or login to cloud `fluvio cloud login` with one simple command."
        - "**Simple CLI**: provision streams, apply stateful computations, produce, consume and more."
        - "**Native APIs**: support for `Rust`, `Node.js`, `Python`, and `Java` with other languages coming soon."
