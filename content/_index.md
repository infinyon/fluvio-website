  items:
    - title: "Unified Cluster"
      description: "A unified cluster for streaming and stateful computation minimizes delay, reduces operational complexity, and boosts security. When streaming and stateful computation are combined, it sets the foundation for a new class of real-time streaming use cases unique to Fluvio. For example:"
      examples:
        - "**Security**: strip out personally identifiable information (PII), and encrypt fields." 
        - "**Cleanse**: map and transform fields, or filter records." 
        - "**Analytics**: compute values, deriving composites, and more."
      icon: "/images/icons/unified-connected.svg"
    - title: "Extensible"
      description: "Fluvio uses WebAssembly(WASM) to extend real-time stateful computation to a countless number of use cases. Custom modules are loaded dynamically and applied to any number of data streams. For example:"
      examples:
        - "**Filter** patients with high blood sugar in real-time."
        - "**Count** all users that have a declined credit card transaction from offset 0."
        - "**Transcode** video file when played to a mobile device with insufficient network bandwidth."
      icon: "/images/icons/extensible.svg"
    - title: "Efficient"
      description: "Fluvio is highly optimized for machine code, and it does not require a virtual machine or garbage collection. It can scale from IOT devices such as Raspberry Pi to multi-core servers."
      examples:
        - "**Low latency:** single-digit milliseconds response at high throughput and consistent variance."
        - "**Low footprint:** small executable and low memory."
        - "**Asynchronous architecture:** non-blocking calls to reduce latency and scale to a large number of concurrent streams."
      icon: "/images/icons/efficient.svg"    
    - title: "Self Healing"
      description: "Fluvio operates the cluster automatically with minimum human intervention. The platform implements self-healing by combining a variety of technologies:"
      examples:
        - "**Declarative Management**: a technology pattern where users declare intent and the system provisions resources as they become available."
        - "**Reconciliation:** the cluster continuously checks system components and brings them to a stable state."
        - "**Replication:** all data streams can have multiple copies to reduce the possibility of data loss during outages." 
      icon: "/images/icons/self-healing.svg"   
    - title: "Developer Friendly"
      description: "Fluvio was built with the development community in mind. It offers a powerful CLI for operational efficiency and native language bindings for most common programming languages. For example:"
      examples:
        - "**One-Click Deploy:** create a cluster locally `fluvio cluster start` or login to cloud `fluvio cloud login` with one simple command."
        - "**Simple CLI**: provision streams, apply stateful computations, produce, consume and more."
        - "**Native APIs**: support for `Rust`, `Node.js`, `Python`, and `Java` with other languages coming soon." 
      icon: "/images/icons/dev-friendly.svg"
    - title: "Batteries Included"
      description: "Fluvio platform has all the necessary components to deploy and run a data streaming cluster. The platform has built-in connectors and stateful computation modules to cover general use cases right out of the box. These connectors and stateful computations can be augmented as needed. We invite and appreciate help from the community to expand our collection of connectors and WASM stateful computation modules."

      examples:
        - "**Runs on Kubernetes**: use helm charts to install and provision Fluvio cluster."
