Some Fluvio CLI commands are distributed as separate executables that we call
"extensions". This command installs and updates extensions by name, placing
them in the `~/.fluvio/extensions/` directory.

```
fluvio-install
Install Fluvio plugins

The Fluvio CLI considers any executable with the prefix `fluvio-` to be a CLI plugin. For example,
an executable named `fluvio-foo` in your PATH may be invoked by running `fluvio foo`.

This command allows you to install plugins from Fluvio's package registry.

USAGE:
    fluvio install [FLAGS] <package>

FLAGS:
        --develop    Install the latest prerelease rather than the latest release
    -h, --help       Prints help information

OPTIONS:


ARGS:
    <package>    The ID of a package to install, e.g. "fluvio/fluvio-cloud"
```

üé£ Fetching latest version for package: fluvio/fluvio-cloud...
