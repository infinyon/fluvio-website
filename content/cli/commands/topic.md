The `fluvio topic` family of commands is used to create and delete topics, as
well as to view basic information about existing topics.

## `fluvio topic create`

This command is used to create new Fluvio topics. A Fluvio topic is a stream where
you send related messages. Different topics have unique names and store their data
independently. They may also be divided into multiple partitions, which can
increase the message throughput of the topic.

```
Create a Topic with the given name

fluvio topic create [FLAGS] [OPTIONS] <name>

FLAGS:
    -i, --ignore-rack-assignment
            Ignore racks while computing replica assignment

    -d, --dry-run                   Validates configuration, does not provision
    -h, --help                      Prints help information

OPTIONS:
    -p, --partitions <partitions>
            The number of Partitions to give the Topic [default: 1]

    -r, --replication <integer>
            The number of full replicas of the Topic to keep [default: 1]

    -f, --replica-assignment <file.json>    Replica assignment file

    --retention-time <time>
            Retention time (round to seconds) Ex: '1h', '2d 10s', '7 days' (default)

    --segment-size <bytes>              
        Segment size in bytes

ARGS:
    <name>    The name of the Topic to create
```

Example usage:

%copy first-line%
```bash
$ fluvio topic create greeting
topic "greeting" created
```

### Retention

If  you want to set a retention time for the topic, you can use the `--retention-time` flag.
The records are fluvio are organized in terms fo segments.  Each segment is a fixed size which can be configured with the `--segment-size` flag.
Any segments which are older than the retention time will be deleted.

## `fluvio topic list`

This command shows you all the existing topics in your cluster, as well as some basic
information about them, including how many partitions a topic has and how many times it
is replicated.

```
List all of the Topics in the cluster

FLAGS:
    -h, --help    Prints help information

OPTIONS:
    -O, --output <type>    Output [default: table]  [possible values: table,
