Similar to the Python client, this client also wraps the rust but does not yet
support any admin features. The calls to using fluvio objects across the
network are all blocking.

To see the full docs, visit [our javadoc page].

## Connect
To get a [connection to fluvio] do:

%copy%
```java
Fluvio fluvio = Fluvio.connect();
```

[connection to fluvio]: https://infinyon.github.io/fluvio-client-java/com/infinyon/fluvio/Fluvio.html#connect()

## Producer
To [create a producer] do:

%copy%
```java
TopicProducer producer = fluvio.producer("hello-java");
```

[create a producer]: https://infinyon.github.io/fluvio-client-java/com/infinyon/fluvio/Fluvio.html#producer(java.lang.String)

### Send

To [send to the topic] do:

%copy%
```java
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    producer.send(String.valueOf(i).getBytes(), ("Hello " + i).getBytes());
}
```

[send to the topic]: https://infinyon.github.io/fluvio-client-java/com/infinyon/fluvio/TopicProducer.html#send(byte%5B%5D,byte%5B%5D)

## Consumer

To [create a consumer] do:

%copy%
```java
PartitionConsumer consumer = fluvio.consumer("hello-java", 0);
```

[create a consumer]: https://infinyon.github.io/fluvio-client-java/com/infinyon/fluvio/Fluvio.html#consumer(java.lang.String,int)

### Stream
For now usage of the [consumer stream]
requires calling `next` on the `stream` as seen here:

[consumer stream]: https://infinyon.github.io/fluvio-client-java/com/infinyon/fluvio/PartitionConsumer.html#stream(com.infinyon.fluvio.Offset)

%copy%
```java
PartitionConsumerStream stream = consumer.stream(Offset.beginning());
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    Record record = stream.next();
    System.out.printf("Consumed record, key=%s, value=%s\n", record.key_string(), record.value_string());
}
```

## Setting up the project

Now we're going to use `gradle` to help us set up the project. Let's create a
new directory for the project:

%copy first-line%

```bash
$ mkdir fluvio-java-app && cd fluvio-java-app
```

Run `gradle init` inside the directory:

%copy first-line%

```bash
$ gradle init

Select type of project to generate:
  1: basic
  2: application
  3: library
  4: Gradle plugin
Enter selection (default: basic) [1..4] 2

Select implementation language:
  1: C++
  2: Groovy
  3: Java
  4: Kotlin
  5: Scala
  6: Swift
Enter selection (default: Java) [1..6] 3

Split functionality across multiple subprojects?:
  1: no - only one application project
  2: yes - application and library projects
Enter selection (default: no - only one application project) [1..2] 1

Select build script DSL:
  1: Groovy
  2: Kotlin
Enter selection (default: Groovy) [1..2] 1

Select test framework:
  1: JUnit 4
  2: TestNG
  3: Spock

This creates a handful of files and directories for us, let's take a look at them.

%copy first-line%

```bash
$ ls -la
drwxr-xr-x  10 nick  wheel   320 Apr 28 16:51 .
drwxrwxrwt  24 root  wheel   768 Apr 28 16:50 ..

drwxr-xr-x   7 nick  wheel   224 Apr 28 16:51 .gradle
drwxr-xr-x   4 nick  wheel   128 Apr 28 16:51 app

-rw-r--r--   1 nick  wheel   377 Apr 28 16:51 settings.gradle
```

It also created a main Java file for us, let's take a look at that too:

%copy first-line%

```bash
$ cat app/src/main/java/fluvio/java/app/App.java
/*
 * This Java source file was generated by the Gradle 'init' task.
 */
package fluvio.java.app;

public class App {
    public String getGreeting() {
        return "Hello World!";
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println(new App().getGreeting());
    }
}
```

Gradle has set up a simple "Hello World" program so that we can test out the
project setup. Let's make sure we can run it. To execute this program, run the following:

%copy first-line%

```bash
$ ./gradlew run
Starting a Gradle Daemon, 1 incompatible Daemon could not be reused, use --status for details

> Task :app:run
Hello World!

BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 7s
2 actionable tasks: 2 executed
```

-> After the initial `gradle init`, we will run all of our Gradle commands using `./gradlew <command>`

Awesome, now that we have the base Java project set up, let's see how we can start
using Fluvio in our application.

### Installing Project Dependencies

In order to use the Fluvio library, we need to add it to our project. We can do that
by editing the `app/build.gradle` file. Let's take a look at it now:

```groovy
/*
 * This file was generated by the Gradle 'init' task.
 *
 * This generated file contains a sample Java application project to get you started.
 * For more details take a look at the 'Building Java & JVM projects' chapter in the Gradle
 * User Manual available at https://docs.gradle.org/7.0/userguide/building_java_projects.html
 */

plugins {
    // Apply the application plugin to add support for building a CLI application in Java.
    id 'application'
}

repositories {
    // Use Maven Central for resolving dependencies.
    mavenCentral()
}

dependencies {
    // Use JUnit test framework.
    testImplementation 'junit:junit:4.13.1'

    // This dependency is used by the application.
    implementation 'com.google.guava:guava:30.0-jre'
}

application {
    // Define the main class for the application.
    mainClass = 'fluvio.java.app.App'
}
```

We need to do two things to add Fluvio to this project:

- We need to tell Gradle where the Fluvio library lives (i.e. which repository)
- We need to tell Gradle the name and version of the Fluvio library

To do this, we'll update the `build.gradle` file like the following:

```diff
  /*
   * This file was generated by the Gradle 'init' task.
   *
   * This generated file contains a sample Java application project to get you started.
   * For more details take a look at the 'Building Java & JVM projects' chapter in the Gradle
   * User Manual available at https://docs.gradle.org/7.0/userguide/building_java_projects.html
   */
  
  plugins {
      // Apply the application plugin to add support for building a CLI application in Java.
      id 'application'
  }
  
  repositories {
      // Use Maven Central for resolving dependencies.
      mavenCentral()
+     maven {
+         name = "GitHub Packages"
+         url = uri("https://maven.pkg.github.com/infinyon/fluvio-client-java")
+         credentials {
+             username = System.getenv("GITHUB_ACTOR")
+             password = System.getenv("GITHUB_TOKEN")
+         }
+     }
  }
  
  dependencies {
      // Use JUnit test framework.
      testImplementation 'junit:junit:4.13.1'
  
      // This dependency is used by the application.
      implementation 'com.google.guava:guava:30.0-jre'
+
+     implementation 'com.infinyon:fluvio-16:0.12.11'
  }
  
  application {
      // Define the main class for the application.
      mainClass = 'fluvio.java.app.App'
  }
```

Notice the `credentials` block. In order to download libraries from GitHub Packages,
we need to provide a GitHub username (the `GITHUB_ACTOR`) as well as something called
a "Personal Access Token" (the `GITHUB_TOKEN`). Let's see how to create the token on
the GitHub website.

#### Creating a Personal Access Token

In order to create a token, click on your user profile on the GitHub website and go to
the "Settings" page.

<img src="/tutorials/images/java/settings.png"
     style="justify: center; max-width: 300px"
     alt="In the profile dropdown, click on the settings item" />

Then, click on "Developer settings" in the left-hand menu.

<img src="/tutorials/images/java/developer-settings.png"
     style="justify: center; max-width: 600px" 
     alt="In settings, click on Developer Settings"/>

Then, click on "Personal access tokens" and "Generate new token".

<img src="/tutorials/images/java/personal-access-token.png"
     style="justify: center; max-width: 780px" 
     alt="In developer settings, click on personal access tokens" />

You'll be prompted to re-enter your password for GitHub, then you'll find a page where
you can grant permissions to your new token. The only permission this token needs is
`read:packages`, so leave all the other fields blank. Then, click Generate Token.

<img src="/tutorials/images/java/new-token.png"
     style="justify: center; max-width: 780px" 
     alt="Add the read packages permission to your token" />

On the next page, you'll be presented with a token that will allow you to download
packages from GitHub Packages. Make sure to copy that token, and let's place it in a
new file called `.env` in the root of your project.

%copy%

```bash
export GITHUB_ACTOR="Your GitHub username"
export GITHUB_TOKEN="Your GitHub token"
```

And as one last step let's set the following permission on the `.env` file:

%copy first-line%

```bash
$ chmod +x .env
```

This pattern of saving tokens and other environment variables to a `.env` file is a
common practice in projects that need to grant access to secret data. It is important
not to commit this file to git, because you don't want to share your `.env` file with
anybody else.

From now on, whenever you want to run your project, start by "sourcing" the `.env` file
to load those variables into your shell:

%copy first-line%

```bash
$ source .env
```

To make sure it worked, let's build and run the project one more time.

%copy first-line%

```bash
$ ./gradlew run
Starting a Gradle Daemon (subsequent builds will be faster)

> Task :app:run
Hello World!

BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 4s
2 actionable tasks: 1 executed, 1 up-to-date
```

If that didn't work for you, double check that you followed all the steps correctly.
Once you have that working, continue on to see how to produce and consume records in
our new app!

### Writing the Application

Now we're ready to write our Java app. In our source file,
`app/src/main/java/fluvio/java/app/App.java`, open an editor and write the following:

%copy%

```java
package fluvio.java.app;

import com.infinyon.fluvio.Fluvio;
import com.infinyon.fluvio.TopicProducer;
import com.infinyon.fluvio.PartitionConsumer;
import com.infinyon.fluvio.PartitionConsumerStream;
import com.infinyon.fluvio.Offset;
import com.infinyon.fluvio.Record;

public class App {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        Fluvio fluvio = Fluvio.connect();
        TopicProducer producer = fluvio.producer("hello-java");
        PartitionConsumer consumer = fluvio.consumer("hello-java", 0);

        for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
            producer.send(String.valueOf(i).getBytes(), ("Hello " + i).getBytes());
        }

        PartitionConsumerStream stream = consumer.stream(Offset.beginning());
        for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
            Record record = stream.next();
            System.out.printf("Consumed record, key=%s, value=%s\n", record.key_string(), record.value_string());
        }
    }
}
```

## Running the Demo

In order to send and receive records from Fluvio, we need to first create a Topic:

%copy first-line%

```bash
$ fluvio topic create hello-java
```

This is the name of the topic we used in our Java code, so make sure you use the same name!

Next, let's open up a Fluvio consumer on the command-line so that we can see the records
being sent to our topic:

%copy first-line%

```bash
$ fluvio consume hello-java -B --key-value
```

This terminal will stay open and start printing out records as they are sent to our topic.

Next, let's use another terminal to run the Java project. Open up your project directory
again and run gradle again.

%copy first-line%

```bash
$ ./gradlew run

> Task :app:run
Consumed record, key=0, value=Hello 0
Consumed record, key=1, value=Hello 1
Consumed record, key=2, value=Hello 2
Consumed record, key=3, value=Hello 3
Consumed record, key=4, value=Hello 4
Consumed record, key=5, value=Hello 5
Consumed record, key=6, value=Hello 6
Consumed record, key=7, value=Hello 7
Consumed record, key=8, value=Hello 8
Consumed record, key=9, value=Hello 9

BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 722ms
2 actionable tasks: 2 executed
```

In your other terminal window with the Fluvio consumer, you should have seen your records appear:

%copy first-line%

```bash
$ fluvio consume hello-java -B --key-value
[0] Hello 0
[1] Hello 1
[2] Hello 2
[3] Hello 3
[4] Hello 4
[5] Hello 5
[6] Hello 6
[7] Hello 7
[8] Hello 8
[9] Hello 9
```
