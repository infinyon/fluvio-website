### Intro

Fluvio Connector Development Kit (CDK) is a command-line tool whose primary goal is to help developers build, test, deploy Connectors, and publish them to the Hub. CDK only supports connectors developed in the Rust programming language. Other languages will be added in future releases.


### Requirements

Install Rust compiler and Cargo. See [https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) for installation instructions.


### Steps

CDK provides a set of commands to help developers build, test, and publish Connector:

1. [Generate a Connector]({{< ref "generate" >}})
2. [Build and Test]({{< ref "build-test" >}})
3. [Start and Shutdown]({{< ref "start-shutdown" >}})
4. [Troubleshooting]({{< ref "troubleshooting" >}})
5. [Secrets]({{< ref "secrets" >}})
6. [Publish to Connector Hub]({{< ref "publish" >}})
7. [Start from Connector Hello]({{< ref "connector-hello" >}})
