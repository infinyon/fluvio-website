Fluvio is a high-performance data streaming platform built for developers. Whether you're looking to add data streaming capabilities to your application, need to aggregate logs for your infrastructure, or are seeking a change-data-capture (CDC) solution, Fluvio is the data streaming platform for you.

Fluvio can be installed on your **personal computer**, in a **private data center**, or on a **public cloud**. Virtually anywhere <a href="https://kubernetes.io/" target="_blank">Kubernetes</a> is available.


## Core Capabilities

Fluvio was designed around three core capabilities:  

* [data streaming](#data-streaming)
* [language native APIs](#language-native-apis)
* [ease of use](#ease-of-use)


### Data Streaming

Data streaming is data that is **generated continuously** by any number of data sources in many different formats. Your data might be:

* logs or traces generated by mobile or web applications
* sensors from industrial robots, drones, or farm equipment
* financial stock tickers
* online purchases
* in-game player activity
* telemetry from connected devices
* database events

and more.

Fluvio data streaming is designed for **horizontal scale**. Multiple data streams can concurrently ingest and replicate data for durability. Data is processed sequentially on a record-by-record basis in the order it was received, and it is stored in immutable streams. A user-configurable retention period controls the length of time the data is retained. The **retention period** can be anywhere from hours to years.

Fluvio **producers** can write to one or more data streams and **consumers** can read from any number of streams.

Fluvio data streaming is designed for _speed_, _scale_, _security_ and _resiliency_.


#### Speed

Fluvio is written in **Rust**, a programming language designed for _code safety_ and _performance_.  For instance, a [benchmark](https://medium.com/@dexterdarwich/comparison-between-java-go-and-rust-fdb21bd5fb7c) comparison between Rust and Java revealed the following differences:

* **Latency**:  Rust is ~ 30x lower than Java (on a Fibonnaci test)
* **Memory**: Rust uses ~25x less memory than Java 
    * **Idle Memory Usage**: Rust uses ~450% less memory than Java
* **CPU**: Rust uses ~3x less CPU than Java 
* **Program Size**: Rust compiles to ~10% smaller image size than Java

Fluvio takes full advantage of Rust's core capabilities: 

* _async runtime_ for concurrent processing 
* _all available cores_ for optimal CPU utilization
* _zero-copy_ for fast I/O wherever possible

While other data streaming platforms use polling to consume messages, Fluvio uses *async processing* for significantly lower latency.


#### Scale

Fluvio is designed for **horizontal scale**, where multiple Streaming Processing Units can be gradually dispatched to handle an increasing number of concurrent data streams.

Fluvio uses **partitioning** to divide data into smaller sub-streams for availability, fault tolerance and manageability. Each partition is an independent data streaming unit that can scale independently. Partitions are distributed evenly across _Streaming Processing Units (SPUs)_ to ensure a balanced system. Fluvio clients can write to or read from multiple partitions simultaneously.

For additional information, check out the [Partition/Partition](/docs/architecture/topics-partitions/) section in the [Architecture](/docs/architecture) document.


#### Security

Fluvio is designed with **security** and **privacy** in mind. Fluvio producers, consumers, and other clients must authenticate with a target Cloud cluster and download security certificates before they are authorized access. The platform uses the certificates with TLS to encrypt all communication between the clients and the cluster.


#### Resiliency

Fluvio is designed for **fault tolerance** and **high availability**. Data streams are replicated for durability and can survive multiple points of failure. Failures may range from crash of a host machine to network outages, and more. Fluvio ensures that data streams remain available with minimal interruption for subsequent processing.

All system components have **self-healing** recovery mechanisms and **automatic failover** to increase resiliency and simplify usability. Fluvio has built-in **eventual consistency** to allow recovering _SPUs_ update their internal state and rejoin the cluster as fully functional units.

For additional information, check out the [Replica Election](/docs/architecture/replica-election/) section in the [Architecture](/docs/architecture) document.


### Language Native APIs

Fluvio is designed to integrate natively with most programming languages.  The following native interfaces are listed in order of priority:

* **Rust**
* **Node.js**
* Swift/Objective-C - *coming soon*
* Python - *coming soon*
* Go - *coming soon*

The APIs can be used to manage and operate all areas of the systems:

* clusters
* data streams
* consumer
* producers

Fluvio is designed for **polyglot** environments where Apps written in various programming languages can be enhanced to support real-time data streaming capabilities.


### Ease of Use

Fluvio is designed for **operational efficiency** and **ease of use**.  

Fluvio has built-in **cluster management** capabilities to normalize and simplify all infrastructure operations. The platform can be installed just as easily on a laptop, a data center, or a public cloud. With integrated Kubernetes capabilities, Fluvio is easy to install in any modern Enterprise environment.

Fluvio is designed **for developers**. A _built-in installer_ helps you get up and running quickly. A _profile-based configuration_ allows you to switch between different Fluvio installations with ease. _Native language_ support gives you the flexibility to pick your programming language of choice, where the data streaming APIs are mapped to native libraries. Fluvio's **developer-first** approach eliminates complexity and minimizes the learning curve required to bootstrap and run a data streaming environment.

Fluvio uses **declarative configurations** instead of imperative commands to manage system resources as topics and partitions. A declarative configuration approach lets the platform provision resources dynamically as they become available and self-heal from failures. Existing data streaming platforms return errors and leave all remediation tasks to the operator to resolve. When using Fluvio, operators give you the confidence to **configure and walk away**. You can trust that the platform will recover from errors and operate at optimal performance.

## Key Features

The Key features of Fluvio are:

* **Ultra Low Latency**: Fluvio takes advantage of Rust's async runtime to improve system performance and achieve low latency. It utilizes all available cores and interacts directly with hardware I/O. Unlike other streaming platforms where garbage collection adds unpredictable latency, Fluvio latency is constant and predictable. 

* **Low Memory Footprint**: Fluvio can be deployed in as little as 100Mb of memory. The deployment is highly optimized machine code and it does not require an intermediary virtual machine. Fluvio can be run on devices such as the Raspberry Pi and are suitable for IOT devices running at the edge.

* **Built-in Durability**: Fluvio uses long-lived immutable storage to persist data streams. Each data stream is copied to multiple servers and retained for hours or years. Fluvio clients have built-in failure detection and switch-over mechanism to minimize downtime. Fluvio's durability mechanism allows clients to come and go without concerns over data loss.

* **Guaranteed Message Ordering**: Fluvio guarantees partition-level message ordering. Messages are stored and forwarded to consumers in the order they are received from the producers. Order guarantee is a critical requirement in many stateful systems.

* **Cloud Native by Design**: CNCF defines “Cloud Native” as an approach that utilizes cloud computing to build and run scalable applications in modern, dynamic environments. Cloud Native products are centered around Kubernetes, often called the “kernel of the cloud”. Fluvio is designed to work with natively with Kubernetes. It uses Helm charts for installation, CRDs for provisioning, and Operators to interact with the KV store.

* **Developer Friendly**: Fluvio offers native language bindings in many modern programming languages such as Rust and Node. Future release will gradually introduce additional languages such as Swift/Objective-C, Python, and Go.

* **Powerful CLI**: Fluvio offers a powerful CLI that controls virtually all aspects the system: installation, provisioning, data streaming, and monitoring. In addition, the CLI can manage any number of installations whether they are on your local system, in your data center, or in the public cloud.
