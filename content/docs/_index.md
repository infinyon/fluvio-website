Written in Rust, Fluvio provides low-latency, high-performance programmable streaming on cloud-native architecture.

SmartModules, powered by WebAssembly, provide users the ability to perform inline computations on streaming
data without leaving the cluster. – [Learn more about SmartModules]({{<ref "/smartmodules" >}})

Fluvio provides client libraries for several popular programming languages. – [Learn more about Fluvio's client libraries]({{<ref "/api" >}})
