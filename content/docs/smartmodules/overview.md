SmartModules are one of Fluvio's premiere features, allowing users to have
direct control over their streaming data by providing a programmable API
for inline data manipulation.
SmartModules are user-defined functions, written in Rust and compiled to
<a href="https://webassembly.org/" target="_blank">WebAssembly</a> - that
means they're lightweight and portable, and enable enormous flexibility for
being integrated at many points in a streaming pipeline. They enhance the
entire streaming platform: reducing network costs by allowing precision 
filtering along the stream and encouraging code-reuse and collaboration.

The following
diagram shows common components which may be configured with SmartModules
performing inline computation.

The diagram shows five places where SmartModules may currently be used:

- In **Source Connectors** and **Sink Connectors**, and
- in programmatic **Producers**, **Consumers**, and the **Fluvio CLI**

SmartModules are typically applied to data _before_ the data is sent from
one location to another. This is so that any filtering that happens will
result in less network traffic and more savings. For example, stream inputs
(i.e. Source Connectors and Producers) will apply SmartModules before
sending data to the Fluvio cluster, and stream outputs (such as Sink Connectors,
Consumers, and the Fluvio CLI) will upload SmartModules to the Fluvio cluster
and process data before the stream is sent over the network. This helps to
overcome "Data Gravity" by moving only the most minimal amount of data necessary.

## Types of SmartModules

Fluvio features the following types of SmartModules:

#### Filter

A Filter SmartModule takes an input record and returns `false` if the record should
be discarded, or `true` if the record should be kept and sent downstream.

#### Map

A Map SmartModule takes an input record and may edit and transform it, returning a
new record that is sent downstream.

#### Filter-Map

A FilterMap SmartModule takes one input record and returns zero or one output record.
This effectively means that it may decide to discard or "filter" any input records, or
to keep them and apply a transformation to them at the same time.

#### Array Map

An ArrayMap SmartModule takes one input record and returns zero or many output records.
This means that the output stream may have more records than the input stream.

#### Aggregate

An Aggregate SmartModule takes input records and "accumulates" them, essentially adding
each input record to a rolling sum. Each input record gets "added" to the sum after the
previous record, and the output stream is full of the "summed" records.

## Using SmartModules

SmartModules may be used in two ways: by registering them by name with the Fluvio cluster, or by
providing them "ad hoc" right when you want to use them. In development, it is useful to use ad-hoc
SmartModules, since the compiled WASM code is changing between each run. However, for most actual
use-cases, it typically becomes much easier to register the SmartModule and later refer to them by name.

#### Registering SmartModules

After building a SmartModule as a WASM binary, it may be registered with Fluvio using
the `fluvio smartmodule` command, providing a name and a path to the binary.

%copy first-line%
```bash
$ fluvio smartmodule create my-filter --wasm-file=target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/my_filter.wasm
```

After creating one or more SmartModules, one may use the `fluvio smartmodule list` command
to see the available SmartModules:

%copy first-line%
```bash
$ fluvio smartmodule list
 NAME       STATUS             SIZE
 my-filter  SmartModuleStatus  108754
```

Finally, to delete a SmartModule, use `fluvio smartmodule delete` and provide the name of the
SmartModule to delete.

%copy first-line%
```bash
$ fluvio smartmodule delete my-filter
```

#### Using Registered SmartModules

You may use a Registered SmartModule anywhere that SmartModules may be used. To use them,
you'll need to provide the name of the SmartModule as well as its type. For example, when
using a registered filter SmartModule with the Fluvio CLI Consumer, provide its name
to the `--filter` argument, like so:

%copy first-line%
```bash
$ fluvio consume my-topic -B --filter=my-filter
```

#### Using Ad-hoc SmartModules

You may still use SmartModules even without registering them with Fluvio. When using
SmartModules this way, you simply provide a path to the WASM file directly when you
use it. For example, when using an ad-hoc SmartModule with the Fluvio CLI Consumer,
you may pass a file path to `--filter` that points to the SmartModule WASM file,
like this:

%copy first-line%
```bash
$ fluvio consume my-topic -B --filter=target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/my_filter.wasm
```
