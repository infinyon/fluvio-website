Welcome! Thanks for your interest in Fluvio, the high-performance, low-latency streaming platform for real-time applications. 

In this guide, we're going to walk through the setup process for getting started with Fluvio.
To start, we'll show you how to install the Fluvio CLI, then later we'll show you how to get access to a Fluvio cluster, either locally or via Fluvio Cloud. Note that both of these options requires you to have the Fluvio CLI installed.

## Installing the Fluvio CLI

The Fluvio CLI (_command-line interface_) is an all-in-one tool for setting
up, managing, and interacting with Fluvio.

-> Please note that the CLI currently only support **Linux** and **MacOS**.

#### Download and Install

Downloading and installing Fluvio is as simple as running the following command!

```bash
$ curl -fsS https://packages.fluvio.io/v1/install.sh | bash
```

If everything works successfully, you should see output similar to this:

```bash

fluvio: 💡 You'll need to add '~/.fluvio/bin/' to your PATH variable
fluvio:     You can run the following to set your PATH on shell startup:
fluvio:       For bash: echo 'export PATH="${HOME}/.fluvio/bin:${PATH}"' >> ~/.bashrc
fluvio:       For zsh : echo 'export PATH="${HOME}/.fluvio/bin:${PATH}"' >> ~/.zshrc
fluvio:
fluvio:     To use Fluvio you'll need to restart your shell or run the following:
fluvio:       export PATH="${HOME}/.fluvio/bin:${PATH}"
```

Notice the steps it lists at the bottom. In order to use the `fluvio` command,
you'll need to make sure that `~/.fluvio/bin/` (the directory where it was installed to)
is part of your system's PATH - the list of directories where your shell looks for
executables. Once you've followed those instructions, make sure you can run the following
commands:

```bash
$ fluvio version
Fluvio CLI           : 0.8.0
