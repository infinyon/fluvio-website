Fluvio is a very young project, so we're still ironing out all the wrinkles
when it comes to the first-time installation process. If you get stuck while
following the [Installing Fluvio Locally] guide, check this page to see if
you're running into one of the more common errors. If you still can't figure
it out, please feel free to [open an issue] or to drop by
[our Discord channel] to ask us for help!

## Help, I'm stuck

Let's try to get you unstuck. Here are some known installation problems and
how to fix them. We're working to shrink this list over time :)

### `fluvio cluster install`: Fluvio system chart is not installed

If you see an error like the one below, it's likely that you forgot to run
the install command with the `--sys` option first.

```
$ fluvio cluster install --chart-version=0.6.0-latest --image-version=latest
Error: 
   0: Fluvio cluster error
   1: An unknown error occurred: Fluvio system chart is not installed, please install fluvio-sys first

Backtrace omitted.
Run with RUST_BACKTRACE=1 environment variable to display it.
Run with RUST_BACKTRACE=full to include source snippets.
```

- **Fix**: Run the following command to install the system chart
(note the `--sys` flag at the end)

```
$ fluvio cluster install --chart-version=0.6.0-latest --image-version=latest --sys
```

### `fluvio cluster install`: Cluster in kube context cannot use IP address

If you see an error like the one below, something went wrong when Fluvio tried to
integrate with Minikube.

```
$ fluvio cluster install --chart-version=0.6.0-latest --image-version=latest
Error: 
   0: Fluvio cluster error
   1: An unknown error occurred: Cluster in kube context cannot use IP address, please use minikube context: 172.17.0.3

Backtrace omitted.
Run with RUST_BACKTRACE=1 environment variable to display it.
Run with RUST_BACKTRACE=full to include source snippets.
```

- **Fix**: We have a command that should help resolve this. It will prompt for `sudo`
because Fluvio needs to add an entry to a special file called `/etc/hosts` in order
to connect to Minikube. Run the following command:

```
$ fluvio cluster set-minikube-context
```

### `fluvio cluster install`: waiting for sc service up come up

Sometimes when running the install command, you might run into a loop like this:

```
$ fluvio cluster install --chart-version=0.6.0-latest --image-version=latest
"fluvio" already exists with the same configuration, skipping

This means that the minikube tunnel isn't running. This can sometimes happen if you
run `minikube tunnel` using `nohup`. If you check your processes for minikube tunnel,
you probably won't see anything:

```
$ ps aux | grep "minikube tunnel"
fluvio    510051  0.0  0.0   9036   728 pts/0    R+   10:26   0:00 grep --color=auto minikube tunnel
```

- **Fix**: You need to run `minikube tunnel` again. Try it this time without using `nohup`.
Open a new terminal window and run the following:

```
$ sudo minikube tunnel
```

### `fluvio cluster install`: 0 of 1 spu ready

Sometimes when running the install command, you might run into a loop like this:

```
fluvio@fluvio:~/fluvio$ fluvio cluster install --chart-version=0.6.0-latest --image-version=latest

```

This means that Fluvio's [Streaming Controller (sc)] is online, but failed to launch a
[Streaming Processing Unit (spu)].

- **Fix**: We need to re-run the Fluvio installer. All we have to do is uninstall the
cluster, then re-install it with the same install command you tried before. To uninstall
Fluvio, run the following:

```
$ fluvio cluster uninstall
fluvio@fluvio:~/fluvio$ fluvio cluster uninstall
removing fluvio installation
removing kubernetes cluster
release "fluvio" uninstalled

deleting all topics in: default

deleting label 'app=spu' object persistentvolumeclaims in: default
persistentvolumeclaim "data-flv-spg-main-0" deleted
```

Then, when you go to re-install it, a successful install will look like this:

```
$ fluvio cluster install --chart-version=0.6.0-latest --image-version=latest
"fluvio" already exists with the same configuration, skipping

### `fluvio cluster set-minikube-context`: Kubernetes config error

On some systems, running the `set-minikube-context` command doesn't work correctly yet.
When you run it, you might see an error like the following:

```
$ fluvio cluster set-minikube-context
Error: 
   0: Kubernetes config error
   1: IO error: Exec format error (os error 8)
   2: Exec format error (os error 8)

Backtrace omitted.
Run with RUST_BACKTRACE=1 environment variable to display it.
Run with RUST_BACKTRACE=full to include source snippets.
```

In this case, you'll need to make an edit to your `/etc/hosts` file manually. The reason
we need to do this is to set a hostname that points to minikube's IP address. Think of it
like a road sign that tells programs where minikube lives. The first thing we need to do
is make sure we can actually see minikube's address.

```
$ minikube ip
172.17.0.3
```

-> The IP address you see for minikube might be different, but that's ok!

The next thing we'll want to do is make a backup of the hosts file so that we can restore
it if something goes wrong.

```
$ cp /etc/hosts ~/Desktop/
```

-> Now, if you want to reset things back to how they were, you can just run `sudo cp ~/Desktop/hosts /etc/hosts`

Then, we want to add a line to the end of `/etc/hosts` that says `172.17.0.3 minikubeCA`.
We can do that with the following command:

```
$ echo "$(minikube ip) minikubeCA" | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts
```

Just so you understand what's going on here, here's what that line does:

- `$(minikube ip)`: This is running the `minikube ip` command inline, and then substituting
the output into the string. After this step runs, the shell will continue executing the rest
of the command like this:

```
$ echo "172.17.0.3 minikubeCA" | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts
```

-> Here, `minikubeCA` is being used as the new hostname for minikube, and `172.17.0.3` is the address

- `sudo tee -a /etc/hosts`: This is the part of the command that writes the line to the
`/etc/hosts` file. It's important that you don't forget the `-a`, otherwise it will erase
the file instead of appending to it! But don't worry, you made a backup :)

To make sure everything worked correctly, let's take a look at the `/etc/hosts` file. You
should see something similar to this:

```
$ cat /etc/hosts
127.0.0.1	localhost
127.0.1.1	your-hostname
...
172.17.0.3 minikubeCA
```

If everything worked correctly, you should now be able to run `set-minikube-context`
successfully:

```
$ fluvio cluster set-minikube-context
Cluster "flvkube" set.
Context "flvkube" created.
Switched to context "flvkube".
```
