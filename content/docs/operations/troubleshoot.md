## Run cluster check

To diagnose abnormal behavior, a good first step is to run `fluvio cluster check`, which checks against common problems and misconfigurations. 

If everything is configured properly, you should see a result like this:

%copy first-line%
```bash
$ fluvio cluster check
Running pre-startup checks...
     âœ… Kubernetes config is loadable
     âœ… Supported kubernetes version is installed
     âœ… Supported helm version is installed
     âœ… Can create service
     âœ… Can create customresourcedefinitions
     âœ… Can create secret
     âœ… Fluvio system charts are installed
ðŸŽ‰ All checks passed!
You may proceed with cluster startup
next: run `fluvio cluster start`
```

## Logs

To discover errors, you should examine logs from the following components:

### SC
%copy first-line%
```bash
kubectl logs -l app=fluvio-sc
```
### SPU
%copy first-line%
```bash
kubectl logs -l app=spu
```

## Handling Bugs

### Records logs and create and GitHub Issue

In the event of a bug in Fluvio, we appreciate if you could save the log output to file and create a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/infinyon/fluvio/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug&template=bug_report.md&title=%5BBug%5D%3A).

### Reach out to community

### Restart Pods

To attempt to recover from the bug, you can try restarting the K8s pods. 

%copy%
```bash
kubectl delete pod -l app=fluvio-sc
kubectl delete pod -l app=spu
```

Fluvio pods are created by either `Deployments` or `StatefulSets`. Therefore deleting them will automatically cause new pods to be started.
