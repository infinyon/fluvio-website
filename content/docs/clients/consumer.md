Consumers are applications that "consume" records from a particular
topic and partition<sup>[1]</sup>. Typically, a consumer will perform actions based
on the events it receives, such as sending a notification or updating
a database. There may be many consumers reading data from a particular
partition at any given time: since the records are persisted, they do
not expire after being consumed.

-> [1] For an overview of Topics and Partitions, see the [Producer documentation]
