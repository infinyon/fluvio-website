This tutorial expects you to already have the Fluvio CLI installed, and InfinyOn
Cloud set up. If neither of these is the case, please follow the [previous tutorial](../cloud-setup/)!

There are two main steps for this tutorial:
* Creating an inbound Connector
  * (optional) attaching a SmartModule
* Creating an outbound Connector
  * (optional) attaching a SmartModule

We will be going through setting up an inbound and outbound Connector, as well
as attaching a SmartModule to the inbound connection.

## Connectors

If you wish to automatically collect information from one source and send it to
Fluvio, or send data from Fluvio to another system, Connectors are the way to go.
When given the information on the interface through the Connector configuration
file, Fluvio can poll a multitude of input types.

To learn connectors, we will be creating one that uses the [HTTP Connector](/connectors/sources/http/)
Connector, pointed at the <a href="https://catfact.ninja" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> catfact.ninja </a>
JSON database.

Then, we will create an outbound connector with the [SQL](/connectors/sinks/SQL/)
Connector, and produce records to an SQL database. You can use any SQL system that
you like, but for an easy setup we will be using the provider
<a href="https://elephantsql.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> ElephantSQL</a>.


### Connector Config Layout

If you wish to use connectors on InfinyOn Cloud, you will have to use a YAML
connector file. We have provided the template file below. To make it useful, it
needs to be populated â€“ which we will do as the next step. See
[the documentation](/connectors/) for the parameters available for use.

{{<code file="code/yaml/connector-template.yaml" lang="yaml" copy="true">}}

Thankfully, filling it out is simple. For any connection, you will need a name,
the connection type, the version of the connection type, and what topic to connect to.


### Inbound Connector

For the HTTP-specific parameters you will need to specify the link it is
polling, and the interval at which it polls. You will also have to specify that
it is using the HTTP connector version `0.3.0`.

{{<code file="code/yaml/catfacts-basic-connector.yaml" lang="yaml" copy="true">}}

This creates a connector named `cat-facts`, that reads from the website
`https://catfacts.ninja/fact` every 30 seconds, and produces to the topic
`cat-facts`.

#### Testing the Inbound Connector

You can register the connector to Fluvio with `fluvio connector create <connector name> --config=<config-file.yaml>`

%copy first-line%
```bash
fluvio connector create --config=./catfact.yml
```

To see if it is running successfully, you have two options: `fluvio cloud connector logs <topic name>`, and `fluvio consume`.

%copy first-line%
```bash
$ fluvio consume cat-facts -dT4
Consuming records starting 4 from the end of topic 'cat-facts'
{"fact":"A cat lover is called an Ailurophilia (Greek: cat+lover).","length":57}
{"fact":"British cat owners spend roughly 550 million pounds yearly on cat food.","length":71}
{"fact":"Fossil records from two million years ago show evidence of jaguars.","length":67}
{"fact":"Relative to its body size, the clouded leopard has the biggest canines of all animals\u2019 canines. Its dagger-like teeth can be as long as 1.8 inches (4.5 cm).","length":156}
```

To delete the Connector, use `fluvio connector delete <connector-name>`.

-> If at any time, you need information on what the connector is doing `fluvio cloud connector logs <connector name>` is quite helpful!

### Outbound Connector

We will be using a <a href="https://elephantsql.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" > ElephantSQL </a>
database for this tutorial. It is fast to set up an account, if you do not have
your own online database already! For safety, the account name and secret key
were censored from the connector. Other than that, this connector should work as is.

~> At the current moment the SQL connector is not fully released, some growing pains may be noticed!

{{<code file="code/yaml/catfacts-outbound-connector.yaml" lang="yaml" copy="true">}}

This configuration file is telling Fluvio to use the latest (`0.1.0`) version of the SQL
connector, to consume from the cat-facts Fluvio topic, and to connect to
ElephantSQL. After connecting to ElephantSQL, the connector proceeds to run the
transform listed.

The transform command should take a JSON object and transform it into an SQL insertion call:
```JSON
{"fact":"Cats have been domesticated for half as long as dogs have been.","length":63}
```
```SQL
INSERT INTO topic_message (fact, length) values ('Cats have been domesticated for half as long as dogs have been.',63)
```

#### Testing the Outbound Connector

saving the config file as `catfacts-outbound-connector.yaml` you can create the connector with

%copy first-line%
```bash
fluvio connector create --config ./catfacts-outbound-connector.yaml
```

You can test that it is working with `fluvio connector list`

%copy first-line%
```bash
$ fluvio connector list
  NAME                TYPE         VERSION  STATUS
  cat-facts           http-source  0.3.0    Running
  cat-facts-outbound  sql-sink     latest   Running
```

## SmartModules

SmartModules are user defined functions set to run on and modify the inputs/outputs to
a Fluvio database. We already saw the hints of a SmartModule in the SQL connector
earlier, but now we will be creating our own connector from scratch!

Want to filter so that only JSON records that match a specific priority tag are
recorded? A Filter SmartModule can be written to only let through records with
specific values. A Map SmartModule could be used to run the same conversion script
on every record entering or leaving the topic.

You create a SmartModule by using Rust and generating it based on the SmartModule
template available [at the github repository](https://github.com/infinyon/fluvio-smartmodule-template/).

### Making a SmartModule

If we want to have cleaner `cat-facts` records and make it so that the facts are
not ensconced in a JSON object, we will need a SmartModule. Specifically we will
need a map SmartModule. Then we will need to move it to a new topic so that the
SQL connector doesn't panic.

We need to go through some setup steps though.

First, check if `wasm32` is listed by `rustup` as an installed target.

%copy first-line%
```bash
$ rustup target list | grep installed
wasm32-unknown-unknown (installed)
x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu (installed)
```

-> If it is not installed, run `$ rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown` to install it.

Next, install `cargo-generate`, this may take a minute or two.

%copy first-line%
```bash
$ cargo install cargo-generate
```

Now you can download the template with `cargo-generate`.

-> You will have to fill in a couple of required arguments below, prefaced by the "ðŸ¤·" emoji.

%copy first-line%
```bash
cargo generate --git https://github.com/infinyon/fluvio-smartmodule-template
ðŸ¤·   Project Name : catfacts-map
ðŸ”§   Destination: /home/[...]/projects/[...]/catfacts-map ...
ðŸ”§   Generating template ...
âœ” ðŸ¤·   Want to use SmartModule parameters? Â· true
âœ” ðŸ¤·   Which type of SmartModule would you like? Â· map
[1/7]   Done: .cargo/config.toml
[2/7]   Done: .cargo
[3/7]   Done: .gitignore
[4/7]   Done: Cargo.toml
[5/7]   Done: README.md
[6/7]   Done: src/lib.rs
[7/7]   Done: src
ðŸ”§   Moving generated files into: `/home/[...]/projects/[...]/catfacts-map`...
ðŸ’¡   Initializing a fresh Git repository
âœ¨   Done! New project created /home/[...]/projects/[...]/catfacts-map

```

There should now be a new directory labeled `catfacts-map` in your working directory.

Now we can edit the `catfacts-map/src/lib.rs` file to get what we need!

{{<code file="code/rust/catfacts-map/src/lib.rs" lang="rust">}}

Now that we have the SmartModule created, we need to compile it and link it to
Fluvio, so that it can be used. Otherwise you would have to remember the entire
path to the `wasm` file.

%copy%
```bash
$ cd catfacts-map && cargo build --release
```

%copy first-line%
```bash
$ fluvio smart-module create catfacts-map --wasm-file="target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/catfacts_map.wasm"
smart-module "catfacts-map" has been created.
```

You can test that it is working by adding it to the Connector config!

### Connecting to an Inbound Connector

To use a SmartModule with a Connector, add it to the Connector config.
Currently you have to specify which type of SmartModule you are using, so it
will be the form of `module-type: name-of-module`.

{{<code-highlight file="code/yaml/catfacts-map-connector.yaml" lang="yaml" lines=10 copy="true">}}

-> In the near future the config arguments be updated so that you only specify that you are using a module; Fluvio will soon be able to take care of determining which module type is being used.

Now it is almost ready, you just need to tell Fluvio to update the Connector;
or recreate it if you deleted it earlier. Use the `update` argument for `fluvio
connector` to update the Connector if it still exists. This will produce to a new
topic, so that the JSONâ†’SQL connector does not break.

%copy first-line%
```bash
$ fluvio connector update --config=./catfact.yml
```

If you deleted the Connector, you can easily recreate it with `fluvio connector create`.

At this point you can run `fluvio consume` again and see how things have changed.

%copy first-line%
```bash
$ fluvio consume cat-facts-map -dkT 4
Consuming records starting 4 from the end of topic 'cat-facts-map'
[JSON] "The average lifespan of an outdoor-only cat is about 3 to 5 years while an indoor-only cat can live 16 years or much longer."
[JSON] "In 1987, cats overtook dogs as the number one pet in America (about 50 million cats resided in 24 million homes in 1986). About 37% of American homes today have at least one cat."
[JSON] "Cats should not be fed tuna exclusively, as it lacks taurine, an essential nutrient required for good feline health.  Make sure you have the proper Pet supplies to keep your cat happy and healthy."
[JSON] "Cat paws act as tempetature regulators, shock absorbers, hunting and grooming tools, sensors, and more"
```

And voilÃ ! We have a database that takes inputs from the user and from a website, and displays it all prettylike for whoever is reading it!
